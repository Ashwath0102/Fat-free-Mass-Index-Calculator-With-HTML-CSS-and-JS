FFMI value to determine whether a person is natural or has used steroids using HTML, CSS, and JS.

FFMI is fundamentally comparable to BMI. Instead of assessing body mass in relation to height, it measures the amount of muscle (fat-free mass) in relation to a person's height. Unlike BMI, FFMI considers body fat, making it a much more effective tool for assessing your progress and potential. This metric measures the body's overall lean muscle mass. Although inadequate, research reveals that FFMI can prompt us to hypothesize whether or not someone is taking or has taken steroids to grow muscle.

BF % represents Body Fat percent, which can be measured using a body caliper or a Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) weighing machine, though these methods only provide a precise value and it is completely normal for body weight to fluctuate between 1-3 percent each day as well as the body fat %, regardless of changes in body composition (the ratio of how much body fat to muscle you have). First of all, most body fat devices are not very accurate, so we can only get a rough idea.
